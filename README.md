# Credit_Card_Dashboard
This is the Data Analytics project made using Power BI & MySQL for Financial Services.
In this project, I have developed a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights of trends and performance metrics that enable the stakeholders to monitor and analyze information effectively.
Key points:
• Developed an interactive dashboard using transaction and customer data from a SQL database, to provide real-time insights.
• Streamlined data processing & analysis to monitor key performance metrics and trends.
• Shared actionable insights with stakeholders based on dashboard findings to support decision-making processes.
